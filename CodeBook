**Project Description**

This code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data.

Source of Data

Original data: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip Original description of the dataset: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

**Data Set Information**

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.


The dataset includes the following files:

   - 'README.txt'
   - 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
   -'features.txt': List of all features.
   - 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
    -'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
    -'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
    -'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
    -'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

**Step 1. Merge the training data with the test data set**

First read and import the following data sets

    features.txt
    activity_labels.txt
    subject_train.txt
    x_train.txt
    y_train.txt
    subject_test.txt
    x_test.txt
    y_test.txt

**Step 2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement**

We create a logical vector that contains TRUE values for the ID, mean and stdev columns and FALSE values for the others.

**Step 3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set**

Merge data subset with the activityType table to inlude the descriptive activity names

**Step 4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive activity names**

Use gsub function for pattern replacement to clean up the data labels.

**Step 5. Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject**
